# UX Notes
- Navigation mirrors Amazon-style layout: sticky header with search, department shortcuts, cart/account access.
- Home page highlights departments, featured items, and KPI cards to reinforce trust.
- Filtering on product listing includes department selection, brand search, price bands, and sort controls.
- Detail page shows delivery/returns/service info blocks and review submission for authenticated shoppers.
- Cart and checkout use chunked cards for summary vs. actions; dummy payment callout clarifies no real charge.
- Orders list uses status badges and action bar for cancellations/returns; service page schedules appointments with a parallel list of existing requests.
